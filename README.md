# Car-Fuel-Efficiency-EDA
Here I performed a EDA on fuel efficiency between gasoline, plug-in hybrids, and electric cars. 

I have imported a .csv to manipulate the data. 
1. Checked shape and data types. 
2. Change data types if needed. 
3. Provided what was missing and their percentages. 
4. Deleted and imputed data when needed. 
5. Provided statistical values and data visualizations.
